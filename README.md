# vbox-vagrant

Dockerfile for creating a ubuntu with virtualbox and vagrant 

### Dockerhub Image
The image can by directly found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/tdeheurles/vbox-vagrant/) or by pulling it :
```bash
docker pull tdeheurles/vbox-vagrant
```

### Issue
The build works but I'm not sure for now how to run it. I'm confronted to a kernel error.  
Seems [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25741904/is-it-possible-to-run-virtualbox-inside-a-docker-container) is a solver to that issue.
